A weather app made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Live demo [here](https://mdesanker.github.io/weather-app/)

The app uses a Geolocation API to get the user's coordinates (latitude and longitude) and displays the weather at their location using the Open Weather API. The search bar allows the user to search for a city name or zip code within the United States to display the weather there. User can choose to display weather in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Learned:

- Working with APIs
- Using async/await functions in JavaScript
- Error handling in async functions
